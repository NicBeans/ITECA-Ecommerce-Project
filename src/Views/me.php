            <h1>Digital Art involving Artificial Intelligence</h1>
            <p>I use a process called text-guided image to image prompting. This means that i create sketches, or sometimes even completed artworks, which are then modified using artificial intelligence tools to give it a unique feel.</p>

            <p>This means that there is only one of each of these works. I do not redistribute sold works.</p>
            <h2>Everything is a one of a kind here.</h2>
            <p>The works will be sold to you as physical prints.</p>
            <p>I also do commisions, so if you have an idea for a piece of art, feel free to contact me.</p>
